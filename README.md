#### Brief explanation of the libraries used in the code (Part 1)
- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- `numpy`: Numerical computing library for handling arrays and mathematical operations.
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: Plotting library for creating visualizations.
- `seaborn`: Statistical data visualization library built on top of matplotlib.
- `sklearn`: spliting training and test data only (Not used for model)


#### Brief explanation of the libraries used in the code (Part 2)
- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- `numpy`: Numerical computing library for handling arrays and mathematical operations.
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: Plotting library for creating visualizations.
- `seaborn`: Statistical data visualization library built on top of matplotlib.
- `sklearn`: Metrics, Model Selection, and Linear model


## How to run

I've submitted both .ipynb and .py files for parts 1 and 2. I did most of my code in google collaboratory so I would prefer any TA or grader look at those first.
If it is necessary to grade and run only the .py files like the instructions suggested, the following steps would otherwise apply:

1. Ensure all libraries are properly imported
2. Run 'python part1.py' or 'python part2.py' from the command line.
3. Profit!!!

### Log

To satisfy the instructed request for a log, I used Pandas in Part 1 to create a DataFrame that would store the resulting MSE values and their parameters. This can be seen in the Part1.ipynb file or
in the screenshots I attached to the report document.

### Plots

To satisfy the instructed request for plots, I used Matplotlib in both Part 1 and Part 2 to generate a correlation matrix for both. This plot correlated the impact of various features and mapped them. In regards to this assignment, it was the only plot that seemed important to include. Screenshots are attached in the report document.
